### 1. **Seed the Supply First (Sellers)**

* Nobody will open your app if it’s empty.
* Before launch, **personally collect listings**: go to hostels, ask friends, batchmates, and seniors who are moving out or upgrading stuff (laptops, bikes, books, guitars, clothes, etc.) to post or even let *you* post on their behalf.
* You want at least **30–50 decent listings** in different categories ready on Day 1.

### 2. **Create Initial Buzz**

* Do a **launch day push**: posters in hostels, mess areas, and WhatsApp/Telegram college groups.
* Memes > formal posters. Students scroll past formal notices but stop for a funny, relatable meme.
* Tagline examples:

  * *“OLX but for Thapar — buy & sell in your hostel”*
  * *“Stop spamming WhatsApp groups. Sell it here.”*

---

### 3. **Narrow Targeting (Hostel → Hostel)**

* Don’t aim for *all students* at once. Start with **your hostel + one popular girls’ hostel**.
* If you win in 1–2 hostels, others will join out of FOMO.
* Word of mouth spreads fastest inside hostels (roommates, corridor talks).

---

### 4. **Incentivize Early Users**

* First 50 sellers get a badge/verified mark.
* Weekly highlight: *“Deal of the week”* on posters or Instagram page.
* Referral: if someone gets 3 friends to sign up & list something, they unlock something fun (could even be non-monetary like profile highlight).

---

### 5. **Integrate into Student Life**

* Tie it to situations students already face:

  * Seniors graduating (tons of used stuff to sell).
  * Fest season (costumes, props, instruments).
  * New batch coming in (they need everything).
* Example: **2 weeks before new batch arrives**, push *“Freshers Deals – Buy everything seniors are selling.”*

---

### 6. **Keep Visibility Alive**

* A dead marketplace dies quickly. Post updates often:

  * Weekly poster: *“Top 5 hottest deals right now”*.
  * Insta page: post funny “Only in Thapar” listings.
* If people see fresh stuff regularly, they’ll keep checking.

---

### 7. **Personal Hustle**

* In a college marketplace, **your personal energy is the growth engine**.
* Talk to hostel wardens (they sometimes help spread word).

---

💡 **Key thing:** Don’t overthink “big advertising.” Your campus is a *closed ecosystem* of a few thousand people. Posters, WhatsApp groups, and word of mouth are 100x more effective than Facebook ads or anything “corporate.”
